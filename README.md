compPLS
=======

An R package for [sparse] Partial least squares discriminant analysis and biplots for compositional data analysis.

This package is the implementation for the method developed in Lee et al. (2014) [**1**] for the classification of independently-sampled microbial compositions based on Helminth-infection status of a people in Malaysia. Under an assumption of model sparsity (that is, relatively few microbial populations truly correlate with Helminth-status) we get a factor analysis as well as a classifier.

Currently, this package consists of functions for compositionally-robust data transformations that you can apply prior to (sparse) partial least squares discriminant analysis: here, just wrappers to key functions from the caret package [**2**]. As described in the paper, I've added parameter selection via cross-validation and bootstrap-based p-value calculation to assess PLS model coefficients (for feature selection). This package also includes some methods for ggplot2-based biplots for PLS-DA output, and for a few other commonly used projection/ordination/classification methods. This code was forked from vqv's biplot package [**3**].

This package is still under development and I am currently adding features, based on some new and exciting microbiome data being generated by the good people at the Loke lab [**4**] and collaborators. Installation and example instructions will be added soon.


Installation
------------
This development package requires the `devtools` package for installation. Additionally, `compPLS` depends on the `caret` and `MASS` packages. Suggested packages are `boot`, (for bootstrapping) `ggplot2`, `grid` and `scales` (for biplots).

```R
 library(devtools)
 install_github('zdk123/compPLS')
```
